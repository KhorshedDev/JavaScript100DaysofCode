//JavaScript variable decleard  by using let,var or const;

//JavaScript variable name must  start with a letter,You cann't use number as a first number,you cann't use reserve word as valiable name like for,while,let etc.

var example2;//it has some hoisting problem

const example3;//it can't be update or reasign;

//JavaScript has 5 Data type 

//Number
 let num1 = 5;//"=" used for asign a data ;

 var nam2 = 20 //number can be integar or float ,it doesn't metter in JavaCript;

 const num3 = 24.67;

//String
 
 let name = "Khorshed" //you must use quate('') for declaring string variable ,it can be single quate or doble("");

//Bolean

let isStart = true //notice? here we start with small letter then used capital letter that called camelCase most used format in JavaScript;

//null

let score = null //null means NaN ;

//Undifined

let lastName = undefined; //undefined use when you want a variable to declare  without it's value;



//You can do basic math to asign a variable;

let sum = 20+25;

let squer = 10*10;

let divition= 10/5;


//you can asign to string together;

let myName="Khorshed" + "alam";

//you can first decleare a varible and than asign it;

let age;

age = 20;


//you can use variable to declare a variable;

let firstName = "Khorshed";
let lastName  = "alam";

let fullName= firstName +" "+ lastName;//space isn't count in JavaScript ,You have to put it where you want.
